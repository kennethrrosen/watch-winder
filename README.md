# Watch Winder

Here you'll find custom code and wiring diagram for the Watch Winder by Damian Lickindorf (<a href="https://www.cgtrader.com/3d-print-models/gadgets/other/watch-winder-by-damian-lickindorf-mechanics-only">models for purchase from CGTrader: $10</a>). I first saw this on Reddit and knew, given the pandemic and my continuously out-of-synch watch as a result from working from home, I needed it. I didn't want to go through the trouble of designing my own when Damian's seemed elegant and without frills.  

The only problem is the package, though supplied with a BOM (below), did not come with an .INO file or wiring diagram.


- 32mm long NEMA11 stepper motor
- 90x140x16 ball bearing - without shielding or you can take the shielding of yourself
- a standard small limit switch DM1-02P or DM3-02P
- a pillow for watches that is about 50mm wide and has the largest diameter of about 70mm
